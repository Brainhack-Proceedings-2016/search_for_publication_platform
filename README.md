# We need a publication platform for Brainhack Proceedings
The primary goals of the Brainhack Proceedings is to provide attendees with an opportunity to publish a short project report that details the work that they completed during events. A secondary goal is to use the proceedings as a means to explain the benefits and impact of Brainhack to others. To acheive both of these goals we would like a publication outlet that embodies the tenents of Open Science, but will also allow us to establish the proceedings as a credible, meaningful, and hence valuable publication outlet. There are a variety criterion that we would like for the publication outlet to satistify:

###Publication Outlet Wish List
1. Open publication
2. Open review
3. Transparent fee structure (ideally would be underwritten)
4. Rolling review and publication of project reports
